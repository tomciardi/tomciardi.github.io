I am a recent MS graduate from Case Western Reserve University, where I conducted interdisciplinary research at the [MDS3 Center](https://mds3-coe.com/) under the supervision of Dr. Yinghui Wu and Dr. Roger French. I broadly worked in scientific machine learning; bridging deep learning and materials science. 

My research focused on developing domain-informed active learning and weak supervision techniques for image segmentation for [synchrotron X-ray computed tomography](https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adem.202401699) and anomaly detection for in-situ sensor data from advanced manufacturing processes. Additionally, I contributed heavily to maintaining and developing our research groups' [compute and data infrastructure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10487079).

Currently I am working as a data scientist for the Cleveland VA. My contract finishes at the start of the 2025 summer so I am actively on the job hunt :)

Previously, I've conducted research at:
- **NASA Glenn Reserach Center:** transfer learning for [microscopy image foundation models](https://github.com/nasa/pretrained-microscopy-models)
- **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory:** sensor fusion and multi-modal learning for defect detection in advanced manufacturing processes
- **Cleveland Clinic:** synthetic MRI image generation for segmentation robustness 

I've also had some industry stints including:
- **RIGID Tools:** NLP email classifiers for support case resolution
- **GE Lighting:** BI dashboard development for smart home technology product usage
- **Insight2Profit:** unsupervised learning for pricing and sales recommendation modeling
